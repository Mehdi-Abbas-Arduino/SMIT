What is data engineering ?
How data storage works ? 
How to move and process data ?

Data Workflow :
1. Data Collection & Storage (Data engineering)
2. Data Preparation (Data engineering : sometimes) (Data Analyst)
3. Exploration and Visualization (Data Analyst)
4. Experiment and prediction (Data Scientist)
NOTE: All of these Data Workflow is done by a data scientist 

Responsibilities :

Ingest data from different sources(From where to bring)
optimize database for analysis
Remove corrupted data
Develop, construct,test and maintain data architectures

Data engineers and big data :
Big data becomes the norm => data engineers are more and more needed 
Big data :
Have too think about how to deal with its size
So large traditional methods dont work anymore 


Big data Growth :
 Sensors and Devices
 VoIP
 Social Media
 Enterprise data

Five V's:
 
Volume (how much ?)
Variety (What kind?)
Velocity (How frequent?)
Value(How useful?)
Veracity(How accurate?)
